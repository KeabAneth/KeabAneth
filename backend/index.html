        const phpDesc = `PHP is a widely-used, open-source scripting language primarily employed for web development. It operates on the server to generate dynamic web content, interact with databases, handle user sessions, and perform other essential tasks. PHP's simplicity, efficiency, and large community support have contributed to its enduring popularity in building a vast array of web applications.`;
        const pythonDesc = `Python is an excellent choice for backend development due to its readability, versatility, and extensive libraries. It excels at handling server-side logic, database interactions, and API development. With frameworks like Django and Flask, building web applications becomes efficient. Python's strengths in data analysis and machine learning also make it suitable for complex backend systems, such as recommendation engines or predictive models.`;
        const nodeDesc = `Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side applications. It's essentially JavaScript for the backend. Known for its asynchronous, event-driven architecture, Node.js excels at handling real-time applications, I/O-bound tasks, and building scalable network applications. It's widely used for creating APIs, web servers, and command-line tools.`;
